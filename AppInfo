# APP_TITLE: Name of the homebrew app, also name of folder and .3DSX/.SMDH
# APP_DESCRIPTION: Description of the homebrew app in HB launcher
# APP_AUTHOR: Author of the homebrew app, also display in HB launcher
#
# PAYLOAD_PATH: Path to the ARM9 payload on the 3DS SD card (don't forget "//")
# PAYLOAD_OFFSET: Offset of the ARM9 payload in the file given above
# PAYLOAD_MAXSIZE: Maximum size of the ARM9 payload, cannot exceed 0x100000
#
# PAYLOAD_MEM: If set to anything, force loading the payload from memory
#
# VOODOO: This may be used to boost the boot rate of a given payload, it can take
#  values from 0x00...0x3F, experimentation is recommended, also see below
#
# If PAYLOAD_PATH is not given, payload is loaded from memory (data dir in source)
# PAYLOAD_OFFSET is optional if offset is 0x00000000
# PAYLOAD_MAXSIZE is ignored if it is zero, and shouldn't be required at all
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The VOODOO parameter:
# This paramter is processed in binary (0b111111 = 0x3F = 63). Starting from the
# right, this is what those bits do (and of course you can combine any of these
# fixes, this is what is intended).
# Bit 0: Load (unnecessary) HB services.
#  0b000001/0x01 => Load them
# Bit 1: "Magic Fix", no one (might not be absolutely correct) knows what it does,
#  but CTR Boot Manager, BootCTR and HBL itself all use it.
#  0b000010/0x02 => Use magic fix
# Bit 2 and Bit 3: Set the length of the bootfix delay.
#  0b000000/0x00 =>   0 frames
#  0b000100/0x04 =>  50 frames
#  0b001000/0x08 => 100 frames
#  0b001100/0x0C => 150 frames
# Bit 4 and Bit 5: Initialize console and print some nonsense text.
#  0b010000/0x10 => Use this fix for the bottom screen
#  0b100000/0x20 => Use this fix for the top screen
